Add a [blog] shortcode to the Wordpress editor to include data from bloginfo()

== Description ==

This plugin adds a shortcode [blog] to pull info from like the template tag bloginfo(). Its very simple to use and supports the same values as bloginfo().

Why a shortcode and not the function in PHP? Sometimes I need to implement slight variations of the same site. This allows me to have the values propagate into the post content as needed without remembering every place that needs changes.

Its used like this:

    [blog info="name"] 

This is the equivalent of the following in PHP:

    bloginfo('name');

Here are some example uses:

	[blog info="name"] - Displays the "Site Title" set in Settings > General.
	[blog info="description"] - Displays the "Tagline" set in Settings > General.
    [blog info="wpurl"] - Displays the "WordPress address (URL)" set in Settings > General.
    [blog info="url"] - Displays the "Site address (URL)" set in Settings > General.
	[blog info="admin_email"] - Displays the "E-mail address" set in Settings > General.
